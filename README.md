Just little disclaimer, I won't update this bot, it was just for fun and I feel like the tecnology used is kinda obsolete, so no real reason to continue it.

ALSO, for this bot to work you need to install ffmpeg.exe and put it in the same directory of the script. Also you should run all of this in a dedicated virtual enviroment as good practice.
